Application Specific Field Exchange Specification
=================================================

CMEPS is a community mediator in that it supports multiple coupling systems.
CMEPS contains two coupled model specific files that determine:
- the fields that are exchanged between components
- how source fields are mapped to destination fields
- how source fields are merged after mapping to destination fields

For CESM, this occurs via the files,::

  esmFldsExchange_cesm_mod.F90 and fd_cesm.yaml

For UFS-S2S, this occurs via the files: ::

  esmFldsExchange_nems_mod.F90 and fd_nems.yaml

UFS-HAFS, this occurs via the files: ::

  esmFldsExchange_hafs_mod.F90 and fd_hafs.yaml

CMEPS advertises **all possible fields** that can be imported to and
   exported by the mediator for the target coupled system. Not all of
   these fields will be connected to the various components. The
   connections will be determined by what the components advertise in
   their respective advtise phase.

Field Naming Convention
-----------------------

The mediator variable names can be seen in the application specific YAML field dictionary. Currently, three
field dictionaries are supported::

  fd_cesm.yaml
  fd_nems.yaml
  fd_hafs.yaml

The CMEPS field name convention in these YAML files is independent of the model components.
The convention differentiates between variables that are state fields versus flux fields.

In naming convention assumes the following one letter designation for the various components as
well as the mediator ::

  x => mediator (where mapping and merging is done)
  a => atmosphere
  i => sea-ice
  l => land
  g => land-ice
  o => ocean
  r => river
  w => wave

State variable names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

State variables have a prefix that always start with an ``S`` followned by a two character string::

  state-prefix
    first 3 characters: Sx_, Sa_, Si_, Sl_, So_
    one letter indices: x,a,i,g,l,o,g,r,w
  state-name
    what follows state prefix

As an example, ``Sx_t`` is the merged surface temperature from land, ice and ocean sent to the atmopshere for CESM.

The following state names are currently supported. Note that each application might only use a subset of these fields.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "state names", "description"
   :widths: 20, 60

   "Sa_dens", "air density at lowest model layer"
   "Sa_pbot", "air pressure at lowest model layer"
   "Sa_pslv", "air pressure at land and sea surface"
   "Sa_shum", "air specific humidity at lowest model layer"
   "Sa_tbot", "air temperature at lowest model layer"
   "Sa_u", "air zonal wind at lowest model layer"
   "Sa_v", "air meridioinal wind at lowest model layer"
   "Sa_z", "air height wind at lowest model layer"
   "Si_anidf", "ice near infrared diffuse albedo"
   "Si_anidr", "ice near infrared direct albedo"
   "Si_avsdf", "ice vissible diffuse albedo"
   "Si_avsdr", "ice vissible direct albedo"
   "Si_ifrac", "ice fraction"
   "Si_imask", "ice mask"


Flux variable names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flux variables specify both source and destination components and have a 5 character prefix::

  flux-prefix
    first 5 characters: Flmn_
    lm => between components l and m
    n  => computed by component n
  flux-name
     what follows the flux-prefix

The following flux prefixes are used:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "flux prefix", "description"
   :widths: 20, 60

   "Faxa\_", "atm flux computed by atm"
   "Fall\_", "lnd-atm flux computed by lnd"
   "Fioi\_", "ice-ocn flux computed by ice"
   "Faii\_", "ice_atm flux computed by ice"
   "Flrr\_", "lnd-rof flux computed by rof"
   "Firr\_", "rof-ice flux computed by rof"
   "Faxx\_", "mediator merged fluxes sent to the atm"
   "Foxx\_", "mediator merged fluxes sent to the ocn"
   "Fixx\_", "mediator merged fluxes sent to the ice"

The following flux-names are used:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "flux name", "description"
   :widths: 20, 60

   "_evap", "air-ice evaporative water flux, positive downwards"
   "_lat", "air-ice latent heat, positive downwards"
   "_lwup", "air-ice surface longwave flux, positive downwards"
   "_sen", "air-ice sensible heat, positive downwards"
   "_swnet", "net short wave, positive downwards"
   "_melth", "net heat flux to ocean from ice"
   "_meltw", "fresh water flux to ocean from ice"
   "_salt", "salt to ocean from ice"
   "_swpen", "flux of shortwave through ice to ocean"
   "_swpen_vdr", "flux of visible direct shortwave through ice to ocean"
   "_swpen_vdf", "flux of visible diffuse shortwave thrrouh ice to ocean"
   "_swpen_idr", "flux of near infrared direct through ice to ocean"
   "_swpen_idf", "flux of near infrared diffuse through ice to ocean"
   "_taux", "zonal stress, positive downwards"
   "_tauy", "air-ice meridional stress, positive downwards"
